# BoneWasher

This code was created for the purposes of cleaning data directly exported from University of Chicago's OCHRE database. 
This is ultimately a preliminary format and future versions will include:
1) Condensed coding structure, incoporating dynamic functions to make the code more concise
2) The introduction of configuration files to improve flexibility between machines
3) The utilization of logging modules to control verbosity and capture logs for debugging
4) implementation of error-handling modules
5) the introduction of VC for manual libraries
6) more thorough annotation of key variables and structures
